        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.</p>

        <p>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, coffee, milk, oil and vinegar. Mix until smooth; the batter will be thin. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</p>

        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.</p>
